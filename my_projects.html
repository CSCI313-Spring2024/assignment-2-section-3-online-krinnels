        By far my favorite project to date is the web-based application that I
        designed for our employees. This project used Microsoft Power Apps, a
        low-code developing tool. While there isn't alot of complex coding with
        it, there was alot of designing, function writing, and table connections
        involved with it. Due to the low-code design of Power Apps, there were
        also alot of restrictions I had to try to navigate around. With this
        app, our employees log all of their transport details including: the
        location of patient pick-up, location of drop-off, time stamps for
        starting and stopping, mileages, and more miscellanous information. They
        also log vehicle maintainance, time cards, and more. They can find
        co-worker information and information sheets for different facilities,
        critical incidents, and more. This app is designed to be as easy to use
        as possible and designed with mobile phone usage in mind.
      </p>

        My next favoite project, which tags on to the first, is the application
        I designed for our management team. Again, it was designed using Power
        Apps in a low-code setting, but the connections to the database tables
        were the most difficult part. This app, being designed for management,
        is far more powerful in terms of what can be accomplished with it. It is
        where the management team can go to look at data that has been input by
        employees, modify data, and create new data that employees will use in
        the employee app. This app was designed primarily to be utilized on a
        desktop platform and is not mobile friendly.
