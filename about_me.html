      <h3>Personal and Professional Life</h3>
      <p>
        I have a daughter that is currently in 1st grade. Along with my goal of
        pursuing my old passion of computers, I want to have a stable career
        that I can support her and also show her that you can achieve anything
        in life with hard work, no matter your age.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently work as the sole IT person at a company that a long-time
        friend started. The company provides non-emergent medical transport to
        patients needing mental/behavior health help and detox help. I began as
        a driver working on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for an 11 day
        stretch out of our Duluth office. After 6 months of taking on that task
        by myself, we finally were able to hire more employees which allowed me
        to move back home. After 2 more months and more company expansion, I was
        able to move positions and provide IT support for our
        continuously-growing company.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this position comes new areas which I had never touched in previous
        jobs, but had an urning to learn. I handle every facet of technology
        within the company. Everything from provisioning devices, maintaining
        users, and maintaining recording devices in our fleet vehicles all the
        way down to creating and maintaining a website and web-based
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to what I do now, I used my Power Sports Technology degree and
        Business Management degree to own and operate my own small engine repair
        shop for 3 years from 2015 to 2018 while also being a part-time 911
        dispatcher. I decided to leave that venture behind me to work as a
        full-time 911 dispatcher in our local area for 4 years. This leads up to
        where I am now!
      </p>
      <p>
        With my past experience, learning in my current employment, and going
        back to school to earn a new degree, I'm hopeful that my future is
        bright!
